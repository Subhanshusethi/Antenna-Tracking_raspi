## Raspberry Pi Antenna Tracking System

This project utilizes a NEMA 17 stepper motor, a TB6600 motor driver, and a Raspberry Pi to create an antenna tracking system. To set up the system, follow the instructions below:

### Hardware Setup
1. Connect the NEMA 17 stepper motor and TB6600 motor driver to your Raspberry Pi. Refer to the provided pin configuration in the code.

### Software Requirements
- Ensure that you have the [Simple Telemetry Library (SiTL)](https://example-link-to-SiTL) installed on your system. This library is essential for testing the code.

### Communication Setup
To facilitate communication with the system, we've included a sample Python script called `send_mavlink.py`. This script demonstrates the communication process. Make sure to adapt it to your specific use case if necessary.

### Main Code
The heart of this project is the `Antennatracking.py` script, which controls the antenna tracking system. This is the main code that you'll need to run to operate the system.

Feel free to modify and improve the code to suit your needs, and have fun exploring the capabilities of this antenna tracking system!
